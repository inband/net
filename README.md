### Goals for 2019

* Build networking knowledge

* Find out **WHY** technologies are used.  What problem were they designed to solve and what are the use cases

* Learn **HOW** technologies behave on the wire.  Lab it up and use tcpdump understand behaviour.  Break it and see how it reacts

* Attempt to find out how technologies are implemented

* Learn to use [github - syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)

* Learn and use automation techniques where applicable

LAB environment/s will consist of: PROXMOX (virtualisation environment), Debian 9 (lxc), FRR (FR routing protocol suite).

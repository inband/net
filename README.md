### Goals for late 2018/2019

* Build networking knowledge

* Find out **WHY** technologies are used.  What problem/s were they designed to solve and what are the use cases

* Learn **HOW** technologies behave on the wire.  Lab it up and use tcpdump understand behaviour.  Break it and see how it reacts

* Attempt to find out how technologies are implemented

* Learn to use [github - syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)

* Learn and use automation techniques where applicable

LAB environment/s will consist of: PROXMOX (virtualisation environment), Debian 9 (lxc), FRR (FR Routing protocol suite).

Why use PROXMOX, Debian and FRR?

I don't have alot of physical HW.  My lab is a HP Proliant G7 380 for PROXMOX.  Cisco C4948 switch and Ubiquiti EdgeLite3 router.  However, I don't think this matters at all and I'm pretty excited to study FRR.  I'm lost without **tcpdump** anyways.
